# Geovim

Geovim is an installer for NeoVim that can be used both locally and on GitPod servers. The goal is to
allow for a custom configuration for NeoVim that is portable and easily installable in a consistent manner.

Currently we are using NVim with AstroVim configs as a baseline and setting up features on top of this
base configuration.

## TODO

- Setup Install Script
- Add Instant.nvim and configure
- Add local path completion
- Test autocomplete for:
  - Typescript
  - Rust
  - Python
- Setup final solution for LSP configuration
